#About
Project with the goal of producing custom homemade shells and antenas for NFC tags using a streamlined workflow. Work has been done to dissolve existing cards and test their chips to retrofit them into custom enclosures.<br/>
Currently this repository contains a coil winder prototype, guide sources for analizing and working with nfc chips, a guide for tuning and making diy antenas, findings on the argentinian system (SUBE), 3d models for standarized tag disks, and keychains and wristbands that work with these.
